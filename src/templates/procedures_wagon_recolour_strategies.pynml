<!--! * Strategies for random recolouring of intermodal containers * -->

<!--!  these are rudimentary in that
       1. they won't recolour within the container group, only between wagons
       2. only 1cc is recoloured due to combinatorial explosion if both 1cc and 2cc are randomised in recolour sprites (those sprites _could_ be generated though)
       3. I didn't check if the random bits used to choose colour set collide with any other uses
       4. this works for train wagons, wouldn't work for ships as individual containers can't be controlled
-->

<!--! partial 2cc support was removed here Sept 2024, as not used -->

<!--!! possibly it would be better better to
     - generate box containers for all the CC variants directly in Polar Fox, including the alternative shade for every company colour
     - then compose those into fixed container groups in Iron Horse (cc1_alt etc), so each group produces 16 colour variants
     - then switch the final sprites on the company current colour
     - seems like work, but it's what ships will probably need to do?
     - would non-trivially complicate generating intermodal container spritesets etc
     - also would remove randomisation from non-box containers
     - so basically, unappealing-->
